# Problem-8

On Sunday morning, Malcolm started to jog along a circular route of 400 m at a uniform speed of 2 m/s.
One minute later, Timothy starts from the same point as Malcolm did, but he jogs in the opposite direction
at a constant speed of 3 m/s. Whenever Timothy meets or catches up with Malcolm along the route, he would change 
his direction. How many times had Timothy changed his direction when Malcolm finished 10 rounds along the circular route?
